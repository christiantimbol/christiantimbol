# christiantimbol

Personal website to show the world who I am! :-) 

Note:
- "files" contains the meat of the website: "uploads" (images), css, js, fonts, resumes, etc. 
- "includes" contains a lone general.js file

- christiantimbol.com first established.

- christiantimbol.com V1.0 is live! I first began writing the site's code with the help of Bootstrap, but I decided that I've been relying on Bootstrap too long so I scrapped my initial design and built this website without it.

- The site is responsive according to different browsers and view-widths, but I need to fix the CSS for mobile a bit.
